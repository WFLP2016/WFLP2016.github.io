***********************************************************

The international workshops on functional and (constraint) logic
programming aim at bringing together researchers, students, and
practitioners interested in functional programming, logic programming,
and their integration. This year the workshop is co-located with two
other events as part of http://nfa.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/LDEC2016/
in order to promote the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and
experiences among and between the communities interested in the
foundations, applications, and combinations of high-level,
declarative programming languages and related areas.

Topics of interest for WFLP include (but are not limited to):

* Functional programming
* Logic programming
* Constraint programming
* Deductive databases, data mining
* Extensions of declarative languages, objects
* Multi-paradigm declarative programming
* Foundations, semantics, nonmonotonic reasoning, dynamics
* Parallelism, concurrency
* Program analysis, abstract interpretation
* Program transformation, partial evaluation, meta-programming
* Specification, verification, declarative debugging
* Knowledge representation, machine learning
* Interaction of declarative programming with other formalisms
* Implementation of declarative languages
* Advanced programming environments and tools
* Software engineering for declarative programming
* Applications

The primary focus is on new and original research results, but
submissions describing innovative products, prototypes under
development, application systems, or interesting experiments
(e.g., benchmarks) are also encouraged.

There are separate submission categories for work-in-progress reports
and system descriptions. Authors are welcome to indicate that they
want to present their work in a talk but not include a paper in the
formal proceedings.

Submission is via EasyChair at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wflp2016

More details about submission format, LaTeX style etc., can be found
on the web page: https://wflp2016.github.io/

The formal proceedings will be published in EPTCS:
